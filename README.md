A basic course to start using Git is Udacity free course [Version Control with Git](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123), that covers the essentionals of using Git.

These cheat sheets summarizes commonly used Git command line instructions for quick reference.

## Markdown
_**Markdown**_ is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formating words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with markdown. Mostly, markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or * . To get a better hands-on practice with markdown text, try this [interactive tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/) on basic markdown concepts or the Udacity free course [Writing READMEs
](https://www.udacity.com/course/writing-readmes--ud777) to create a good readme files using marldown.
