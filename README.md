# Guides, cheat sheets and tutorials

# Overview
This repository contains useful information about guides, cheat sheets and tutorials used to develop and document. In general is very basic information, but enough to start. Read and practice.

* C/C++
* Python
* Dockers
* ROS/ROS2
* Git
* Markdown
* Machine learning
* Computer vision (OpenCV)

## Python

## Dockers

## ROS/ROS2

## Git
Git is the open source distributed version control system that facilitates GitHub activities on your laptop or desktop. A basic course to start using Git is Udacity's free course [Version Control with Git](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123), that covers the essentionals of using Git. There're planty good courses on the web, just take one, learn basic concepts and start working with git on your next project.

These cheat sheets summarizes commonly used Git command line instructions for quick reference.

## Markdown
Generate a clear and easy to understand documentation is a basic task of a project. _**Markdown**_ is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formating words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with markdown. Mostly, markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or * . To get a better hands-on practice with markdown text, try this [interactive tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/) on basic markdown concepts, the Udacity free course [Writing READMEs](https://www.udacity.com/course/writing-readmes--ud777) to create a good readme files using markdown or the next website [makereadme](https://www.makeareadme.com/)

Also, you can bookmark either of the following two cheatsheets:

* [Cheatsheet by Adam Pritchard](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

## Machine learning
Machine learning and neuronal networks (and all the other stuffs around) are very hot topics (since many years). As in others topics there's tons of information but if you want some relative quick and with good balance between the kowledge requirements and results, I can recomend you the Machine Learning Course from Coursera. On this [link](https://github.com/vkosuri/CourseraMachineLearning) you can find all the documentation you need.

* [CNNs comprehensive guide](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-convolutional-neural-networks-the-eli5-way-3bd2b1164a53)

One important topic for me is CNN for 3D point cloud data:
* [Deep Learning for 3D Point Clouds: A Survey](https://github.com/QingyongHu/SoTA-Point-Cloud)
 
## Computer vision (OpenCV)
Like on the other topics computer vision is very useful tool for many things. OpenCV is one of the libraries used to deal with images and videos to obtain information.
